		<h2>CCTV Maintenance Checklist</h2>
		<p>
			Follow through the steps on the checklist to safeguard and maintain
			your surveillance system appropriately and to ensure that your CCTV
			system is running on an operational status:
		</p>
		<h3>Camera Lens</h3>
		<p>
			The main thing to check for and avoid with the camera lens is causes
			and potential causes of obstruction, which will limit the view of
			the camera.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Check that nothing is obscuring the field of view of the lens
				and adjust if necessary
			</li>
			<li>
				Keep the camera clean to prevent any build-up of dust that could
				prohibit the device performance
			</li>
			<li>
				Check the focus and ensure that the cameraâ€™s functions are
				working (i.e. pan our and zoom)
			</li>
			<li>
				Clean any marks off, as build-up will lead to eventual view
				obstruction
			</li>
			<li>Ensure that any foliage is trimmed back</li>
			<li>
				Check that the cameras are firmly attached to the post or wall
			</li>
			<li>
				If your CCTV has motion detection, check that they are working
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Wiring</h3>
		<p>
			Conduct a visual inspection of all major components on your CCTV,
			including connections &amp; cabling for signs of deterioration or
			damage.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Check for any loose wires, exposed or fraying wires and cables,
				and general wear and tear
			</li>
			<li>
				Check the image quality and ensure that you are getting a clear
				transmission of the pictures and not hearing any distortion with
				the sound
			</li>
			<li>Check that the power supply to the device is working</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Control Equipment</h3>
		<p>
			Check that all the elements of the CCTV control equipment, such as
			monitors, switches, VCR, DVR, and Multiplexer, are functioning
			sufficiently.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Check that the quality of the image on the monitor is clear and
				the brightness and contrast settings are adjusted correctly
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove any grime and dust build-up on the monitors and control
				panels
			</li>
			<li>
				Check that cables on the control equipment are not damaged,
				deteriorating or have any weak connection points
			</li>
			<li>
				Check that the monitor is displaying the correct date and time
				stamp
			</li>
		</ul>
